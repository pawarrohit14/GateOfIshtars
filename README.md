# GateOfIshtars
Problem statement - https://github.com/SegulaTechnologies/GateOfIshtar
Background
We are developing an action/roll-playing game which is happening in the ancient babylonian time. One important object in this fantasy world is “The Gate Of Ishtar”. Different champions in the game should occasionally pass through the gate and meet with the “council of wise”. 
Simple enough! But be aware that sometimes there are ancient gods and demons who guard the gate and they can hurt our champions that dare to pass the gate. 
Below you can find the requirement draft:

The amount of health (HP) a champion may lose varies between 7 and 25 HP depending on the time of the day (different god and demon forces are appearing during the day).
“Brand” the god of fire and “Mithra” goddess of the sun have the highest damage and a champion will lose more HP when they are guarding!
Champion should only lose HP once every hour
Some Magical champions (e.g. Wizards, Spirits) are able to deceive the guards and pass through the gate without losing any HP
Tuesdays and Thursdays are holly days in ancient babylon, so neither gods nor demons roam around the Gate. Our champions are safe from harm on the holly days.
Champions initial health are:
Human 100
Wizard 100
Spirit 100
Giant 150
Vampire 110
Your assignment
The previous developer of “The Gate of Ishtar” is working in a different section nowadays (he realized that his passion lies in graphic design) and claims that the solutions is almost ready to release. You are now the new developer of this feature! 
Your job is to deliver the code and from now on, you are the responsible go-to-person for this solution. This is a solution you will have to put your name on as the creator of “The Gate Of Ishtar”. 

This should be already given by the nature of any programming assignment, I might even offend your glorious programmer's ego if I remind you this! 

You are a software developer not someone who happens to know a programming language and hack something together (does this remind you of our previous developer who happened to be a graphic designer!). Your future is intertwined with how well you apply good software practices and avoid code smells! After all every natural born software developer respects that!

Instructions
You will find more details about your assignment if you check the previous developers code. You can make any modifications or suggestions for modifications that you see fit. 
Fork this repository and deliver your results via a pull-request. You could also create a gist, for privacy reasons, and send us the link.

But wait! I don’t know python!
No worries! we accept submissions in other languages as well!
